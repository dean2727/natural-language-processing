# Natural Language Processing

This repository hosts the code that I got from Codecademy's **Natural Language Processing with Python** skill path. I really enjoyed learning NLP and the various ways NLP is used, from word embeddings, to recurrent neural networks, to the various language models for text analysis, and I hope to use my newfound knowledge on future projects or in my future career.
